# RENS excercise

Create a component that has

1. an image background that changes after 5 seconds (images are stored in `images` folder)
2. a big text in the center (font size is not important in this task)
3. 2 dots on the right, when click, it changes the background image

See provided designs in `design` to visualize the component or go to https://www.allbirds.com/ for example

## clone the project

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adityagyawali/rens-frontend-task.git
```

## Some Changes

1. there are 3 dots on the right as there were three images
2. there are no dots in the mobile potrait version. I checked the example website and it also didn't have for mobile version
